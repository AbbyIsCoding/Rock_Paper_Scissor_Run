# Rock_Paper_Scissor_Run
Rock Paper Scissor game


This is a game that I made in the spring of 2022 for my intro to cs class. The game is basically Rock Paper Scissors where you have to make split second decisions in order to win. 

Controls: 
Left and right arrow keys to move 
Press 1 to change into a rock 
Press 2 to change into a paper 
Press 2 to change into scissors
